                <h1 class="vis">WHITEPAPER</h1>
                <p>Earth 2022, Tigers grew tired of being pets for celebrities and decided to take action. THE switch
                    has been FLIPPED</br>
                    If Humans can do it, then we definitely can do it better!!! Join us and grab the role of your
                    favorite movie. Show humanity that you can do it better. We are a super exclusive group of Tigers
                    that knows its worth.</br>
                    Our actions will not stop at acting only! There is a whole Digital ecosystem growing with us.</p>
                <p>Roles: In our community tigers are welcome to get assigned roles in order to keep our community well
                    educate on what is happening in the world. Information in marketing, technology, gaming, politics
                    all are welcome in their time and place. Tigers with roles will have exclusive entries in channels
                    (like moderators) and will get rewarded in Popcorn (tigers must eat!!!).</p>
                <h2 class="titlewithimg">Popcorn <img src="../imgs/popcorn.png" title="Popcorn"></h2>
                <p>Popcorn can only be rewarded to HWT holder or NFT owners.</p>
                <p>Like all actors, we also are not acting for free. If you stake your IOUs then you will be rewarded in
                    Popcorn (50 Popcorn per month). Popcorn is our favorite snack and DEV team will be buying Popcorn
                    back at the price of 20 XRP for 100 Popcorn, once per month.</p>
                <h2>Utility</h2>
                <p>Popcorn can be used to buy products from the HWT Club. Only HWT holders or NFT owners will be allowed
                    to buy. With Popcorn you will be able to buy some of HWT tokens in discount, also, special items
                    from the movies will be able to be bought with Popcorn. (Tonny Montana’s Little friend, or Jack’s
                    Sparow’s compass in NFTs). When an individual manages to hold both the hero of the movie and his
                    favorite item, then they will be able to ask our artist to make them a new combined NFT featuring
                    both NFTs (the two NFTs will be merged into one, thus they will be burned). In order for this
                    request to take place Popcorn must be paid. As we evolve our ecosystem Popcorn will be getting more
                    utility as voting rights and more.</p>
                <h2>Post Presale</h2>
                <p>When first presale ends, tokens will be staked. Everyone will be able to stake their tokens with only
                    one condition tokens must be staked at full entities (1 full token, 10 full tokens not 1,5 not
                    10,3). Staked Tokens will be accumulating Popcorn. An extra 50 popcorn will be airdropped for every
                    5 HTW staked. {if someone stakes 20 HTW will get (20*50) + (4*50) =1200 Popcorn}. If someone stakes
                    more than 20 HTW, then the extra Popcorn will be 100 instead for every 5 staked. That means that if
                    you stake 25 HTW you will be getting (25*50) + (5*100) = 1250 +500 = 1750 Popcorn.</p>
                <p>200 HWT tokens will be able to be traded for 100 Popcorn each. There will be created 3.500.000
                    popcorn multiplied by the months left, after the staking starts, for the year to end. That means
                    that if staking starts on May, then 12-5=7, will be created 24,5 million of Popcorn. There will be
                    two wallets holding Popcorn, one will hold the Popcorns issued at first and the other wallet will
                    hold the Popcorns that are bought back and the Popcorns that are traded for items or NFTs.</p>
                <p>The Popcorns will be distributed to NFT owners and IOU stakers, until end of December, then the
                    Popcorns held in the 1st wallet (the one holding the issuing tokens) will be burned. This will give
                    Popcorns deflationary value. The only Popcorns that will be left, will be those that are already
                    circulating.</p>
                <p>1/3 of the money the project will be making will be Reinvested. This will happen for 2 reasons.1st:
                    We are planning to make a brand out of our name. We will be the most exclusive club and we plan on
                    be active with many more features joining our brand later on. Planning on ahead, it is better to
                    make our money work for us instead of sitting on a bank account.</p>
                <p>2nd: Our most trusted club members will be rewarded from these money as dividends. Holders of 20 or
                    more tokens will be getting dividends depending on their holdings. Later on, when it will be
                    possible to combine your actor with his items, a whole combined NFT, will be also taking some of the
                    profits.</p>
                <p>Why not take those money for ourselves? Those money are for the project in order to be safe and
                    wealth in depended. Also, as an exclusive club we believe that our biggest asset is our club members
                    and that is why they must be rewarded. Although the capital will not be much at start, ongoing into
                    the future will be getting bigger and bigger. More for this will be discussed in private discord
                    group.</p>
