                <h2>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h2>
                <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
                <p>It is Hollywood Tigers's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                    operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                        href="https://hollywoodtigers.com">https://hollywoodtigers.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
                    "https://hollywoodtigers.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
                    identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
                    ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
                    information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
                    Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
                    collection of information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                    general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
                    visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

                <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, Hollywood Tigers collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                    that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                    preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Hollywood Tigers's purpose in
                    collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Hollywood Tigers's visitors
                    use its website.</p>
                <p>Hollywood Tigers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                    addresses for logged in users. Hollywood Tigers only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
                    under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                    described below.</p>

                <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain visitors to Hollywood Tigers's websites choose to interact with Hollywood Tigers in ways that require
                    Hollywood Tigers to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                    Hollywood Tigers gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who want
                    to communicate with us through our contact page to provide their full name, email address and phone
                    number.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
                    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                    party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                    Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices
                    of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

                <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Hollywood Tigers may change its Privacy Policy from time to
                    time, and in Hollywood Tigers's sole discretion. Hollywood Tigers encourages visitors to frequently check this
                    page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
                    Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
